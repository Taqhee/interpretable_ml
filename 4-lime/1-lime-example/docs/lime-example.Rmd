# Abstract

In this document I will just reproduce a working LIME example and explore the results and how LIME works.


# Load data and fit model

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(lime)
data(biopsy)
library(magrittr)

# First we'll clean up the data a bit
biopsy$ID <- NULL
biopsy <- na.omit(biopsy)
names(biopsy) <- c('clump thickness', 
                   'uniformity of cell size', 
                   'uniformity of cell shape', 
                   'marginal adhesion',
                   'single epithelial cell size', 
                   'bare nuclei', 
                   'bland chromatin',
                   'normal nucleoli', 
                   'mitoses',
                   'class')

# Now we'll fit a linear discriminant model on all but 4 cases
set.seed(4)
test_set <- sample(seq_len(nrow(biopsy)), 4)
prediction <- biopsy$class
biopsy$class <- NULL
model <- lda(biopsy[-test_set, ], prediction[-test_set])
```

# Predict test set

```{r}
predict(model, biopsy[test_set, ])
prediction[test_set]
```

Predictions are pretty good, and pretty solid (with very high probabilities).

# Explain predictions

Let's see how these predictions came to be:

```{r}
explainer <- lime(biopsy[-test_set,], 
                  model, 
                  bin_continuous = TRUE, 
                  quantile_bins = FALSE)

explanation <- explain(biopsy[test_set, ], 
                       explainer, 
                       n_labels = 1, 
                       n_features = 4)

View(explanation)
```

Let's plot it:

```{r}
plot_features(explanation, ncol = 1)
```

I see some problems in the way LIME shows the influence of features. In the **Case 7**, it looks like the negative influence of **barei_nuclei** in greater than the other three variables. How does that explain the final label: *benign*? I guess the rest of the features outweigh the negative influence of **barei_nuclei**. But that is not explicitly shown here!! That's a disadvantage of this method against the XGBoost Explainer method.

Meybe we can increase the number of desired features to avoid this effect:

```{r}
explanation <- explain(biopsy[test_set[2], ], 
                       explainer, 
                       n_labels = 1, 
                       n_features = 10)

plot_features(explanation, ncol = 1)
```

Well, that solves the problem. But the **other** feature would be nice.
